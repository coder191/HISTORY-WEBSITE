    The dream of worldwide democrats and socialist nations was first picturised by Frederic Sorrieu in a painting in 1848; although nationalist struggles had started as early as 1789.
    A few features were highlighted by Sorrieu that lead to the evolution of the term, Nation State:<br>
    <ul type="disc"><img src="repubb.jpg" align="right" alt="La RÃ©publique Universelle 1848" height="200" width="300">
    <li>End of Absolutist Institutions.</li>
        <li>A sense of <i>Common Identity</i> and a common history.</li>
    <li>Liberty, Fraternity, Power of the People(Plebisite).</li>
    </ul>
      
      <hr width="60%">
      
    <b>What is Nationalism &amp; Liberty?</b><p>
Nationalism is defined as a feeling of patriotism. Liberty(Obtained from the latin word <i>liber</i>; which means free) is defined as the freedom of an individual, equality before law, freedom of religion and freedom of speech.
      </p>
    <p>
        Liberalism can be divided into 3 broad categories:
        <dl>
            <dt>Political Liberalism</dt>
            <dd>It stands for the end of autocracy and privelages by birth. Political liberalism emphasises on equality before the law, government by consent, a fixed constitution and universal suffarage.<br>
            In the ninteenth century it also stressed on inviolability of property.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Social Liberalism</dt>
            <dd>It is defined as the freedom of lifestyle and equality of oppurtunity. A society where there exists no discrimination on grounds such as, racial, sexual, or religious.<br>
            Socially &amp; Politically the landed aristrcracy was the dominant class on the continent. However, this group occupied a small percentage of the population. During the age of revolutions the educated upper middle class came into being as a result of the industrial revolution. It was this social group that led the revolution on social grounds.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Economic Liberalism</dt>
            <dd>Laissez-Faire is the freedom of trade throughout a vast region, for the steady growth of the economy.<br>
            In early Europe there were innumerable obstacles to traders &amp; businessmen:<br>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>There were no uniform weights or measures; resulting in lengthy calculations.</li>
                <li>In some countries there were more than 30 types of currencies.</li>
                <li>A large number of tariff/tax barriers reduced the profit of traders.</li>
                </ol>
            </dd>

            TheÂ French RevolutionÂ was a period of far-reaching social and political upheaval inÂ FranceÂ that lasted from 1789 until 1799, and was partially carried forward byÂ NapoleonÂ during the later expansion of theÂ French Empire. The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, experienced violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon that rapidly brought many of its principles to Western Europe and beyond. 
             <img src="bastille.png" width="300" height="200" alt="The Storming Of Bastille" align="right">
            Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution profoundly altered the course ofÂ , triggering the global declineÂ Â while replacing them withÂ republicsÂ andÂ liberal democraciesÂ Through theÂ Revolutionary Wars, it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from theÂ CaribbeanÂ to the Middle East. Historians widely regard the Revolution as one of the most important events inÂ human history. <br>
            Napoleon BonaparteÂ (1769-1821), also known asÂ Napoleon, was a French military leader and emperor who conquered much of Europe in the early 19th century. Born on the island of Corsica,Â NapoleonÂ rapidly rose through the ranks of the military during the French Revolution.
            He proclaimed himself Emperor Napoleon I in 1802. In 1804 he introduced a civil code(commonly known as code napoleon)that granted the much demanded liberties to the people at that time.

            TheÂ Congress of ViennaÂ (German:Â Wiener Kongress) was a conference of ambassadors of European states chaired byÂ AustrianÂ statesmanÂ Klemens Wenzel von Metternich, and held inÂ Viennafrom November 1814 to June 1815, though the delegates had arrived and were already negotiating by late September 1814. The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from theÂ French Revolutionary WarsÂ and theÂ Napoleonic Wars. The goal was not simply to restore old boundaries but to resize the main powers so they could balance each other off and remain at peace. The leaders were conservatives with little use for republicanism or revolution, both of which threatened to upset the status quo in Europe. <br>

            France lost all its recent conquests, while Prussia, Austria and Russia made major territorial gains. Prussia added smaller German states in the west,Â Swedish PomeraniaÂ and 40% of theÂ Kingdom of Saxony; Austria gainedÂ VeniceÂ and much of northern Italy. Russia gainedÂ parts of Poland. The newÂ Kingdom of the NetherlandsÂ had been created just months before, and included formerly Austrian territory that in 1830 becameÂ Belgium.
            <br>
                     The immediate background wasÂ Napoleonic France'sÂ defeat andÂ surrender in May 1814, which brought an end to twenty-five years of nearly continuous war. Negotiations continued despite the outbreak of fighting triggered byÂ Napoleon'sÂ dramatic return from exile and resumption of power in France during theÂ Hundred DaysÂ of MarchâJuly 1815. The Congress's "Final Act" was signed nine days before his final defeat at Waterloo on 18 June 1815.<br>

            The liberal nationalist tried to free their respective countries from the rule of the conservatives and as a result they got themselves increasingly associated with revolutions in many regions. The liberal nationalists mainly consisted the literate middle class men.
The first upheaval took place in France in July 1830. 
            <img src="BGs/france1830.png" width="300" height="200" alt="Revolution Of 1830" align="right">
            During the conservative regime the bourbon ruler who had been restored to power was overthrown. In his place, Louis Phillipe, a constitutional monarch was installed. Subsequently the revolt sparked an uprising in Brussels, which led to Belgium's Independence from the Kingdom of Netherlands.<br> 
            After this event Austrian chancellor Duke Metternich made a remark that when France sneezes the rest of Europe catches cold. His remark on the situation was true due to the subsequent uprisings that took place in the rest of Europe.

            Greece had been part of the <u>Ottoman Empire</u> since the fifteenth century.the growth of revolutionary nationalism in Europe sparked off a struggle for independence amongst the Greeks which began in 1821.<br>
            Nationalists in Greece got support from other Greeks living in exile and also from many west Europeans who had sympathies for ancient Greek culture. The treaty of Constantinople of 1832 recognized Greece as an independent nation.

            After the <a href=#1815>Vienna Congress</a> Poland was divided among the three great powers: Prussia, Austria and Russia. Since the Polish could not win in combat aginst the three powers it sought to a different form of rebellion; <b>Romanticism.</b><br>
            Romanticism meant a movement which emphasised one past, one history, one culture. Patriotism among people was instilled by means of literature, folk music and dance.<br>
            After Russian occupation, the polish language was forced out of schools and the Russian language was imposed everywhere. In 1831,an armed rebellion against Russian rule took place which was ultimately suppressed. Many members of the clergy in Poland  began to use the Polish Language at church gatherings and for all religious instruction; as a result a large number priests and bishops were put in jail or sent to Siberia by Russian authorities as a punishment. The use of polish became a symbol of struggle against Russian dominance.

            Napoleon introduced the Napoleonic code which actually sparked off the German unification in the early 1800s and which was much unspotted by other nations even Germany itself. Napoleonâs administrative measures had created out of countless small principalities a confederation of 39 states. In 1834, a customs union called Zollverein was formed by the initiative of Prussia and joined most of the German states which reduced the customs. The currency was also reduced to 2 these measures created economic stability and hence helped in German unification. The initiative to nation building was represented by combined forces of monarch and military supported by large landowners (called junkers) of Prussia. <br>
            Prussiaâs chief minister, Otto Von Bismarck carried out the unification process with army and bureaucracy with the policy of blood and iron.
The Austro-Prussian war or the battle of Sadowa (1866) between Prussia and Austria ,Saxony, Bavaria etc.  The Schleswig war between Prussia and Denmark and
 the battle of Sedan in 1871 between Germany and Prussia. All the three of these wars were won by Prussia. As a result Germany was finally unified as one nation which was completely under the guidance of Prussia and Otto Von Bismarck.
Napoleon too holds a credit in unifying Germany through his administrative measures in early 1800s.

            Italians were scattered over several dynastic states as well as the multi-national Habsburg empire. In the 19th century Italy was divided into seven states, of which ,only one Sardinia-Piedmont was ruled by an Italian princely house.
The north was under Austrian Habsburgs, the center was under the pope and the south was under the bourbon kings of Spain. The failure of revolutionary uprisings in 1831 and 1848 resulted in the transferring of the responsibility of Italian unification to Victor Emanuel II, the ruler of Sardinia-Piedmont. <br>
His Chief minister, Cavour led this unification process; he was neither a democrat nor a revolutionary, his major advantage was his brilliance at speaking French.
Through his tactful diplomatic alliance with France he with the help of French forces defeated Austrian forces in 1859. A large number of armed volunteers under the leadership of Giuseppe Garibaldi also joined the fray. In 1860 they marched into south Italy and the Kingdom of Two Sicilies and succeed in winning the support of the local peasants in order to drive out the Spanish rulers.
These wars and alliances led to the unification of Italy and victor Emanuel II was proclaimed as the king of united Italy. However the final step of Italian unification was completed after the battle of Sedan in 1871.<br>

            <i>'Because Nationalism was too mainstream!'</i><br>
            Unlike other nations at the time the formation of Britain did not come about by revolutions or romanticism; it was simply forceful annexation.<br>
            TheÂ Acts of UnionÂ were twoÂ Acts of Parliament: theÂ Union with Scotland Act 1706Â passed by theÂ Parliament of England, and theÂ Union with England Act passed in 1707 by theÂ Parliament of Scotland. They put into effect the terms of the TreatyÂ that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries. By the two Acts, the Kingdom of EnglandÂ and theÂ Kingdom of Scotlandâwhich at the time were separate statesÂ with separate legislatures, butÂ with the same monarchâwere, in the words of the Treaty, "United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britainâ The Acts took effect on 1 May 1707. On this date, the Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament united to form theÂ Parliament of Great Britain, based in theÂ Palace of WestminsterÂ in London, the home of the English Parliament.Â Hence, the Acts are referred to as theÂ Union of the Parliaments. <br>
            On the Union, the historianÂ Simon Schama said "What began as a hostile merger, would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history."

            It is utmost crucial to note that although kingdoms <i>did</i> make a transition to nation states due to the revolts of the people; the power was still in the hands of the upper class and conservatives(since nations were contitutional monarchies).<br>
            Thus, here began the evolution of nationalism to <b>Extreme Nationalism</b><br>
            This led to technologically and economically advanced nations dominating other regions. 
            <p>An area of tension after 1871 was the Balkan area. It comprises of modern day Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Macedonia, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia;  their inhabitants were broadly known as 'Slavs.'<br>
            Serbia, the largest of the Slav states took the initiative of unification and spread romantic nationalism. At the same time the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire caused this region to become a platform for European Power rivalry.<br>
            Liberal nations such as Britain, France and Russia backed Serbia's stance, whereas conservatives such as the Ottoman Empire, Germany, Austria and Italy countered them.</p>
            The immediate cause of the World War was when the Austrian Crown Prince was assasinated while travelling through Serbia.<br>

      The consolidation of theÂ British East India Company's rule in the Indian subcontinent during the 18th century brought about socio-economic changes which led to the rise of an IndianÂ middle classÂ and steadily eroded pre-colonial socio-religious institutions and barriers. A rising political consciousness among the native Indian social elite (including lawyers, doctors, university graduates, government officials and similar groups) spawned an Indian identityÂ and fed a growing nationalist sentiment in India in the last decades of the nineteenth century.<br>

            <div class="title">The Gandhian Era</div>
            Gandhiâs strict adherence to democracy, religious and ethnic equality and brotherhood, as well as activist rejection of caste-based discrimination andÂ untouchabilityÂ united people across these demographic lines for the first time in India's history. This in turn led to the popular struggles with the demands for the formation of nation -state , a system which was already created by that time in  Europe.
